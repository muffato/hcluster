# hcluster_sg

My clone of the sourceforge subdirectory for `hcluster_sg`, Heng Li's tool for hierarchical clustering.

I am **not** maintaining this software (but [@douglasgscofield](https://github.com/douglasgscofield/hcluster) is).
I made this repo after I realised that @douglasgscofield missed some of the historical commmits when the tool was still internally called `gcluster`, because I wanted to use GitHub releases to tag the various versions, and link Heng Li's commits to his GitHub account.

*Note* that Heng Li's version 0.5.1 does not compile, and like @douglasgscofield I had to make a couple of minor changes in the code.
